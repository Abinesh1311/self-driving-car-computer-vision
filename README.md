🚗 Self-Driving Car Prototype

Project Overview
This project demonstrates a mini self-driving car prototype using
Computer Vision and sensors. The system can detect lanes, obstacles,
and navigate autonomously.

Objective
- Build a basic autonomous navigation system
- Detect lanes and obstacles using camera input
- Control vehicle movement using Python and Arduino

Technologies Used
Python
OpenCV
Arduino
Sensors (Ultrasonic / IR)
Computer Vision

System Workflow
Camera Input → Image Processing → Lane/Object Detection →  
Decision Making → Motor Control (Arduino)
